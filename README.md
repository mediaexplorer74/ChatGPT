## Problem
To make the app work, you need to set the [OpenAI API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

Caution: This mechanism is geo-dependant. VPN and sms-emulation needed for many countries... so... :( 

## TODO
Switch Avalonia engine to XF (xamarin Forms) "system" or... UWP :)

## ..
As is. Rnd only.
